Each synthesis approach has its own directory within `src/<approach>/` and its own test file `test/test_<approach>.jl`. Within the `src/<approach>/` directory, there is a `README.md` file that describes the approach and an `<approach>.bib` file that contains any references for the approach. Preferably, make use of https://dblp.org/ for references to keep the bibliography consistent.
